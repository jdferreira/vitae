\section{Ongoing Research}

My current research efforts are focus on the application of semantic-web related technologies to multidisciplinary data, especially biomedical data, which usually exhibits high degree of multidisciplinarity. I summarize my efforts in four topics.

\subsection{Multidisciplinary data-mining}

Application of information-mining technologies to multidisciplinary data, including text- and data-mining of biomedical related information, with a particular emphasis on the use of semantic similarity measures to that effect. Data sources include health records, metabolic pathway descriptions, scientific publications, digital representations of biomedical entities, \emph{etc}.


\subsection{Machine-learning in biomedical data}

Application of machine-learning algorithms (in particular neural networks and deep-learning algorithms) to biomedical data. I have not yet started to research this topic, but I will in the very near future.


\subsection{Semantic similarity}

Exploration of several ideas to improve semantic similarity measures in a multidisciplinary content. For the moment, this consists in a set of measures of relevance of concepts in an ontology.


\subsection{Data quality}

Assessment of data quality by measuring some characteristics of the associated metadata, which including measuring the specificity and coverage of the metadata.
